# Meson-UI

## overview

* * *

Meson-UI is an open source build GUI meant to be both extremely fast, and, even more
importantly, as user friendly as possible.

The main design point of Meson-UI is to provide a standalone portable build GUI and
allow the user to access all or most of Meson build systems features.

## preview

Please add an image for the user to see.

## tooling

* * *

The targeted audience we are building for is **Windwos 10**, **MacOSX**, **ChromeOS**, and
**Linux** users. This project uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) `3.8.x` and newer.

## Test, Install and Run

* * *

We should make sure the test run with no failed test cases:

```console
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pytest test/run_tests.py
```

Installing should be easy. We install the application like so:

```console
python3 setup.py install
```

And finally we run this cool application:

```console
meson-ui
```
